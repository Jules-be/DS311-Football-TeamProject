We can see there are 211 teams in the list, but teams should represent a country.
In 2023, there are 193 member states recognized by the United Nations. 
Additionally, there are 2 observer states: the Holy See (Vatican City) and the State of Palestine, making a total of 195 recognized entities according to some source.
So, we can wonder why there are more teams in the FIFA list (past 30 years) than there are countries in the world?

Well, the reason is simple. In the FIFA list, there are teams like Greenland, Puerto Rico or Tahiti.
These teams are parts of countries, but still are independant teams. 
Greenland is part of Denmark, Puerto Rico part of the US and Tahiti part of France.


There is a total of 64 048 goals scored since 1993.
It represents an average of 2134 goals per year.
