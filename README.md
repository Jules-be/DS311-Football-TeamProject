# Objectives

This group project is designed to bring first hand data-driven project experience to students. Students should be applying what they've learned in this course to explore the dataset which is chosen by the team. Students need to collaborate with their group members in this project and learn the project management skills.

# Dataset

Students are provided with 4 datasets from different industries as stated below. Each dataset can be used to answer some specific business questions. We are choosing the FIFA World Cup Data (sport folder).

# Project

We will have to answer 6 questions. We can choose 3 from the list of questions provided in the dataset, and we have to come up with 3 other questions.

For each question we are answering, the answer must be supported with data that can be tables or graph.
